### Description
Every data in a Python is represented by objects, its class model supports advanced polymorphism notations, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance. Object Oriented programming is extremely easy to apply with the simple syntax provided by Python. Likewise, it is also important to note that in Python, Object Oriented programming is an option and not something mandatory as it is in Java; since Python is multiparadigm and allows us to program following an Object Oriented model or an imperative model.
